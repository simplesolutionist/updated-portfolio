    "bio": "Hi there! I'm Ayman üë®üèΩ‚Äçüíª, a detail-oriented self-starter with more than 2 years experience in software development, app and website design, and project management. As a Frontend Software Developer, I've had the opportunity to lay the foundation of startups while also helping to build & scale their companies. I have a great track record of proposing solutions that enhance the goals and vision of clients and businesses. Along the journey, I've realised my passion existed in front end technologies and web development. I've made it my mission to mentor and assist those trying to find their way and break into the tech industry while also taking it upon myself to seek new challenges and embark on career-growth opportunities when possible. I deliver REAL VALUE by driving projects in deadline-driven environments from concept to completion and ensure the work assigned is done in a timely manner and within budgetary constraints.",
